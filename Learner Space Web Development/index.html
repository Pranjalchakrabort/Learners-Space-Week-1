            <p>
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The game's rules are defined in the "Laws of cricket" owned and maintained by the private Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Lord's Cricket Ground, London. The game has various formats, ranging from T-10(Ten-10) played in around 90 minutes to Test matches which can last up to five days. The game is internationally regulated by the International Cricket Council(ICC).</p>

            <p>
            Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after association football (soccer). Although there are a limited number of cricket playing nations currently, cricket is gaining more popularity of late, making inroads into the United States and various countries in Asia, Europe and Africa.</p>

            <h3>History of Cricket</h3>
            
            <p>
            It is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a wicket gate) as the wicket.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>In 1597 (Old Style – 1598 New Style) a court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in Guildford, Surrey, mentions the game of creckett. A 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played creckett on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the Free School. Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey circa 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies in the 17th century, probably before it had even reached the north of England. In the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the West Indies by colonists and to the Indian subcontinent by East India Company mariners in the first half of the century. It arrived in Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788. New Zealand and South Africa followed in the early years of the 19th century.

            <h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
            
            <h4>Playing Area</h4>

            <p>The field is usually circular or oval in shape, and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line, or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.</p>
            
            <p>In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart. The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.</p>

            <h4>How the Game is Played</h4>

            <figure>
                <img src="Images/Screenshot 2024-07-07 180508.png" alt="" width="50%" height="25%">
                <figcaption>Murlidharan bowling to Adam Gilchrist, two greats of the game</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>
                Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding bats, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days.

            <h2>Game Highlights</h2>

            <p>
            Cricket is played in several formats, ranging from T20 to test cricket. Each of these formats has it's own flagship tournaments/world championships where cricket playing nations fight to be crowned champions.</p>

            <p>
                Apart from that, each country has it's own domestic circuits, with franchise cricket being often as if not more popular than international cricket.
            </p>
             
            <h3>Popular Events</h3>

            <h4>International Competitions</h4>
            
            <p>
                Most international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes">The Ashes</a>.</p>
                
                <p>
                The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men%27s_Cricket_World_Cup">ICC Men's Cricket World Cup</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_T20_World_Cup">ICC T20 World Cup</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy">ICC Champions Trophy</a>. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship">ICC World Test Championship</a>, had been proposed several times, and its first instance began in 2019. The game's only appearance in an Olympic Games was the 1900 Olympics. However, it is scheduled to make a return, with the T20 format of the game, in the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.</p>

            <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
            <h3>Equipment Needed</h3>
            <p>Here is an exhaustive list of equipments needed for playing professional cricket:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collared shirt (white in tests and domestic; as per team kit in one-day formats) with short or long sleeves depending on the climate or personal preference.</li>
                <li>Long trousers (white in tests and domestic and first class cricket; as per team colour kit in one day format or T20).</li>
                <li>Jumper (a knitted pullover, if necessary). This may be long-sleeved or sleeveless. This is only for colder climates.</li>
                <li>Sun hat, <a href="Images/Nma.img-ci20082088-094-ei-vs1.jpg">cricket cap</a> or baseball cap during hot summer times</li>
                <li>Spiked shoes to increase traction.</li>
                <li>Protective equipment
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="Images/Vintage_JayBee_Jockstrap.jpg">Jockstrap</a> with a cup pocket into which a "box", or protective cup, is inserted and held in place.</li>
                        <li><a href="Images/Protective_cup.jpg">Abdominal guard</a> or "box" for batsmen and wicket-keepers (often referred to as a cup or abdo guard). It is usually constructed from high-density plastic with a padded edge, shaped like a hollow half-pear, and inserted into the jockstrap with the cup pocket underwear of the batsmen and wicket-keeper. This is used to protect the crotch area against impact from the ball.</li>
                        <li><a href="Images/Cockfosters_Cricket_Club_blue_cricket_helmet_at_Cockfosters,_London,_England.jpg">Helmet</a> (often with a visor), worn by batsmen and fielders close to the batsman on strike to protect their heads.</li>
                        <li><a href="Images/The_wicketkeeping_and_batting_pads._(Image_has_been_cropped_for_better_representation).jpg">Leg pads</a>, worn by the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper, used to protect the shin bone against impact from the ball. The wicket-keeping pads are slightly different from the batsmen'. Fielders that are fielding close to the batsmen may wear shin guards under their trousers.</li>
                        <li>Thigh guards, arm guards, chest guards, and elbow guards protect the body of the batsmen. Some batsmen use these and others do not, since they reduce mobility.</li>
                        <li><a href="Images/Cricket_gloves_at_Highgate_Cricket_Club,_Crouch_End,_London.jpg">Gloves</a> for batsmen only, thickly padded above the fingers and on the thumb of the hand, to protect against impact from the ball.</li>
                        <li><a href="Images/Wicket-Keeping_Gloves.jpg">Wicket-keeper's gloves</a> for the wicket-keeper. Usually includes webbing between the fingers</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><a href="Images/GandM_Purist_156g_cricket_ball_n01.jpg">Ball</a> – A red, white or pink ball with a cork base, wrapped in twine covered with leather. The ball should have a circumference of 9.1 in (23 centimetres) unless it is a children's size.</li>
                <li><a href="Images/Kashmir_willow_Cricket_Bat.jpg">Bat</a> – A wooden bat is used. The wood used is from the Kashmir or English willow tree. The bat cannot be more than 38 inches (96.5 cm) long and 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide. Aluminium bats are not allowed. The bat has a long handle and one side has a smooth face.</li>
                <li><a href="Images/Cricket_Stumps_en.svg.png">Stumps</a> – three upright wooden poles that, together with the bails, form the wicket.</li>
                <li>Bails – two crosspieces made of wood, placed on top of the stumps.</li>
                <li>Sight screen – A screen placed at the boundary known as the sight screen. This is aligned exactly parallel to the width of the pitch and behind both pairs of wickets.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If this huge list feels intimidating, do not fear. Just like every other sports, you can play cricket casually without all the bells and whistles. In fact thousands of people do just that, with just a bat and a plastic ball, with everyday objects like stray bricks made into wickets. In India this is known as gully cricket, and this is where a lot of the greats of the game have had their start, and you can too!!</p>

            <h3>Physical Excercises</h3>
            <p>Cricket is a sport that needs a combination of talent, skill, agility, endurance and fitness. Amongst all of these, your fitness is the most important.There can be test matches where you need to be fielding for days and hundreds of overs under the hot sun and still be on the losing side. Also, you may not be the most technically gifted or talented, but if you’re supremely fit and can give your all to the team, you can be an asset.</p>
